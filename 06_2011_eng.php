On the background of the shrinking number of academic hours to study chemistry invitations to the presentation of a children’s chemical studio, which took place at the Polytechnic museum, and to the regular Moscow research and practice conference of chemistry teachers, just beginners, “A Step towards the Pedagogical Mastership”, were accepted as an encouraging sign.</p>
