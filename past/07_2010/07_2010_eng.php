In the Moscow Region Town of Dubna atoms of element # 117 have been
isolated for the first time ever. Until recently research of scientists
from Russia, the USA, Germany, Switzerland, and some other countries
allowed receiving the information regarding existence of atoms of elements
with atomic numbers up to 118, but there were no any atoms of element # 117

the short form, as at physics lessons, but rather an expanded scheme, which
reflects the essence of a chemical process. Then in the course of the task-

actions and formulate it in the form of a logical chain of solving
(algorithm), which contains, except of the order of actions, necessary for
